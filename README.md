# LibraryFriends

- This application is meant to store personal reading lists as well as share book recommendations publicly via follower relationships and follow feeds. 

## Note on Dependencies
- The application uses ruby on rails as well as a number of other gems as specified in the gem file. The application also uses omniauth for Facebook and thus requires using openssl, eventmachine, and thin to start a 'https' secure server when running this application in a local environment as well as a Facebook developer id and secret.
